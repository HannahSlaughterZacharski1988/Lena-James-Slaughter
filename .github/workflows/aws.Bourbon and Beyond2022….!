# This workflow will build and push new container images + new pages + new workflows + new addresses + new equipment + new tickets + new salaries to Kings of Leon....
# and then will deploy task definitions to Kings of Leon.....when there is a push to the "KOL" branch.

#    Add to  the value of the `KOL_REPOSITORY` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's name.
#    Add to the value of the `KOL_REGION` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's region.
#
# 2. Create KOL clusters......!
#    For example, follow the Getting Started guide on the KOL consoles:
#      "https://us.console.aws.kingsofleon.com/home......"
#    Add to the value of `+KOL_SERVICES` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the Amazon ECS service.
#    Add to the value of `+KOL_CLUSTERS` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the cluster.
